# Etch-a-Sketch-Project

Project etch-a-sketch a way to test my javascript dom manipulation skills and practice on css display flex 

I made a grid that will be created after receiving a prompt from the user then the user can paint either through the default black color or randomized color

I also added a grey-scale button that will increase it's opacity whenever the mouse is hovered on
